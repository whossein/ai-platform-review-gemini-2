/**
 * Contract smoke test.
 *
 * `core` has no runtime logic, so there is nothing behavioral to test yet. This
 * test exists to (a) prove the barrel exports are wired and importable, and
 * (b) act as a compile-time cohesion check across the domain model: if any
 * contract references a type that doesn't exist or breaks, this file fails to
 * type-check and CI catches it.
