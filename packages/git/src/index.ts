/**
 * @ai-review/git
 *
 * Provider-agnostic git integration (Phase 9, ADR-0005):
 *  - `GitLabProvider` — first concrete provider (self-hosted REST v4),
 *    implementing read MR/diff/discussions, create/reply/resolve discussion,
 *    approve, and pipeline status.
 *  - `MapGitProviderRegistry` — dynamic provider registration by kind.
 *  - `ReviewPublisher` — maps adjudicated issues → inline discussions + summary.
 *  - `FetchHttpClient` — production HTTP transport (injectable for tests).
 *  - `parseGitLabMrUrl` — resolves an MR URL into a `ChangeRequestRef`.
 *  - `resolveDiffInput` — resolves raw diff or remote PR/MR URLs into normalized diff text.
 *  - `parseDiffToFiles` — parses unified diff hunks into simulated source files.
