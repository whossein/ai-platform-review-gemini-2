/**
 * Zero-dependency `.env` loader.
 *
 * The platform reads all configuration from `process.env` (see the LLM layer's
 * `providerFromEnv`). But a `.env` file on disk is NOT automatically loaded by
 * Node — something has to read it into `process.env` first. This helper does
 * that using Node's built-in `process.loadEnvFile` (Node ≥ 20.12 / 21.7), with
 * no third-party `dotenv` dependency.
 *
 * It walks up from the current working directory to find the nearest `.env`
 * (so it works whether you run from the repo root or a package folder), loads
 * it if present, and is a silent no-op when absent — preserving the "runs fully
 * offline on the mock with zero config" behaviour.
 *
 * Values already present in `process.env` win over the file (real environment /
 * CI secrets are authoritative); `loadEnvFile` does not overwrite existing keys.
 */
