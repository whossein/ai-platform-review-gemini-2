/**
 * Critic — the review flow's consolidation stage (before the Judge).
 *
 * Specialist agents run in parallel and independently, so they frequently report
 * the *same* underlying problem (e.g. the security and code reviewers both flag a
 * hardcoded secret on the same line). Publishing both would be noisy and, over
 * incremental reviews, wasteful. The Critic:
 *
 *   1. Groups issues that refer to the same defect (file + line + category).
 *   2. Merges each group into a single representative issue, keeping the highest
 *      severity and boosting confidence when multiple agents independently agree
 *      (corroboration), while recording every agent that contributed.
 *
 * It is deterministic, free, and fully unit-tested. A future LLM-backed Critic
 * (semantic dedup across differing wording) can implement the same `critique()`
 * contract without changing callers.
